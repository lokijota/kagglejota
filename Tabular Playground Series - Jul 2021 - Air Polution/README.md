# Tabular Playground Series - Jul 2021

From: <https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-jul-2021/data>

In this competition you are predicting the values of air pollution measurements over time, based on basic weather information (temperature and humidity) and the input values of 5 sensors.

The three target values to you to predict are: target_carbon_monoxide, target_benzene, and target_nitrogen_oxides.

Submissions are evaluated using the mean column-wise root mean squared logarithmic error. The RMSLE for a single column calculated as indicated in <https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-jul-2021/overview/evaluation>. The final score is the mean of the RMSLE over all columns.

The submission must must predict a probability for the TARGET variable (each of the three pollutants).
